# sendanor/inventory-backend

This is a simple REST backend for inventories (especially for Ansible).

You could also think of it as a simple database between shell scripts and web apps. See also our 
[shell client](https://github.com/sendanor/ib) for it.

### Development Status

The project currently is [actively developed](https://github.com/sendanor/inventory-backend/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open).

This is an unstable development version. 

The first stable release is expected to arrive later 2020/12.

### Commercial Support

Commercial support up to 10 years is available from [Sendanor](https://sendanor.com). 

We will increase the price 10% weekly after [weekly milestone is completed](https://github.com/sendanor/inventory-backend/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open).

Finnish customers can purchase the support plan from [our webstore](https://nor.fi/ansible). Please [contact us](https://sendanor.com), if you would like to purchase the plan from outside of Finland.
